# sign_up_form
Sign-up Form project is part of The Odin Project curriculum

## Goal
The past couple of days I've been learning a lot of new concepts and techniques on more advance HTML and CSS. I want to be able to put all of those concepts and conventions together implementing them effectively and in a sensible way for this project. CSS positioning, default styles, relative units, fallback, custom properties and advance selectors, as well as following appropiate conventions on form styling and client-side validation
